<p>A taut wire perimeter security system is essentially an independent screen of tensioned tripwires typically installed on a fence or wall. Alternatively, the screen can be made so thick that there is no need for a supporting chainwire fence. These systems are developed to discover any physical effort to penetrate the barrier. Taut wire systems can run with a variety of switches or detectors that notice movement at each end of the tense wires. These detectors or switches can be an easy mechanical contact, static force transducer or an electronic strain gauge. Undesirable alarms triggered by birds and other animals can be prevented by changing the sensing units to overlook items that put in small amounts of pressure on the wires.
