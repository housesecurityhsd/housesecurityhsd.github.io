<p>Like the Nest Webcam IQ Indoor, this design has Familiar Face notifies, which can determine individuals the camera is finding using face recognition. When it finds an individual in the frame, it will ask whether you know that person and if so to tag them by name. After a while, the camera will find out to identify those people and will send out smart device notifies with that details when they show up at your home. We believe this function (which needs a Nest Aware membership) is more beneficial outdoors, where you are more likely to want to identify predicted visitors from random complete strangers. We also found the function to be more trustworthy on the IQ Outdoor than on the indoor IQ model (on the indoor design, this function was always asking us to identify faces on a nearby TELEVISION). Three microphones (versus the Nest Webcam Outdoor's one) also supply a wider range of audio, so you can much better hear what's going on in recordings. </p>
