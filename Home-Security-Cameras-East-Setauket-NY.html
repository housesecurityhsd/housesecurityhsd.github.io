<p>After checking dozens of wired and wireless alternatives, the best home security camera for the majority of people is the Arlo Pro 2. It tape-records high-definition, 1080p video both day and night, is completely wireless, and can be established both indoors and out, as it's weather condition resistant. Frontpoint's monitoring prices are a little high compared to other systems out there. We like that Frontpoint does not have a contract, and its equipment rates is extremely affordable, so it's not a total splurge. But you will pay more for Frontpoint monitoring than you would for the similarity Vivint or Brinks.</p>
