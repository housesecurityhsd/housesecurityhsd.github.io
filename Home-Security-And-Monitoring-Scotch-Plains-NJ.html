<p>Lighting: Many security cameras are able to shoot in what is referred to as "low-light infrared," enabling them to capture clear video in dark conditions. These cameras rely on infrared LED lights, which cover the dark location in infrared light. Unlike human beings, the camera is able to see this infrared light, so when those wavelengths show back, it's as if the camera is shooting footage in a lit up space. The more IR LEDs that a camera has, the much better it has the ability to see in the evening. If recording footage in the dark is a top priority, make sure your camera has lots of IR LEDs.</p>
<p>The passive infrared (PIR) motion detector is among the most typical sensors discovered in household and small business environments. It uses budget-friendly and reliable performance.
