<p>With modern alarm system systems from Security Instrument, you and your household will have the very best defense possible from burglaries and theft. We discovered the Circle 2 isn't quite as good as the Nest Cam for outdoor usage. It has a 10-foot power cord that limits positioning, and it isn't weatherproof (you can add a weatherproof cord, but doing so makes each unit cost more than a single Nest). Likewise, if you don't decide to use HomeKit Secure Video you'll require to register for a $10 monthly Circle Safe membership to have taping storage and advanced functions, such as notices that compare individuals and basic motion. We think that's expensive.</p>

<p>Although it has a great deal of flexibility in positioning, the Nest Cam Outdoor does need a source of power, so it should be placed within reach of an outlet.

It's prolonged, and that's a good thing if your favored mounting place isn't near to an outlet.
