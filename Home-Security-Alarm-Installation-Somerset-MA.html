<p>What actually sets this design apart is Nest Aware, a subscription service that can be pricey but is important.

Having the ability to compare an automobile and an individual, for example, allows you to reduce unnecessary informs. And Activity Zones are a great perk, especially if you're wanting to monitor a particular corner of the backyard, an entrance, or even trash bin. </p>
