<p>A system that needs a contract may be a wise option for those who are cash-strapped or don't want to pay for the equipment up-front. Why? Because contract-based security systems typically do not featured upfront costs. Rather, the costs are spread out over the length of the contract. We've seen 1-year, all the way up to 5-year contracts! On the other hand, we suggest contract-free systems if you don't wish to sign on the dotted line and be locked into a long-term contract (and who does?). Our pick: No contract.</p>

Anyone with an 802.11 receiver (laptop and wireless adapter) and a freeware wireless packet analyzer can acquire the MAC address of any sending 802.11 within variety. In an organizational environment, where most wireless devices are "on the air" throughout the active working shift, MAC filtering supplies just an incorrect complacency because it prevents just "casual" or unintentional connections to the organizational infrastructure and does nothing to prevent a directed attack.</p>
