In an effort to keep undesirable eyes from peering into your personal life, be sure you're deliberate about what you share on the Neighbors function and are implementing conscious security practices when it concerns these devices.</p>
<p>When customers cancel their service, the City does not reimburse license fees to alarm-monitoring companies. Specific alarm companies might have their own policies relating to refunds. The City is enabling subscribers to change monitoring companies without charging the new monitoring company for a license charge that was paid within the calendar year by the previous monitoring company. Be prepared to offer your new company with the documentation of prior payment.</p>
<p>MAC filtering works only for small residential (SOHO) networks, because it provides protection only when the wireless gadget is "off the air". Any 802.11 gadget "on the air" freely sends its unencrypted MAC address in its 802.11 headers, and it needs no special equipment or software to find it. Anybody with an 802.11 receiver (laptop computer and wireless adapter) and a freeware wireless packet analyzer can get the MAC address of any transferring 802.11 within range. In an organizational environment, where most wireless gadgets are "on the air" throughout the active working shift, MAC filtering provides just an incorrect complacency because it avoids only "casual" or unintended connections to the organizational infrastructure and does nothing to avoid a directed attack.</p>
