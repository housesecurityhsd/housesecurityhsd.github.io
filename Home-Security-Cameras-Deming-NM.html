<p>Two-way audio: While the concept of a security camera implies eyes-on monitoring, the ability to also hear what's going on offers you a more total picture of what's occurring on the home front when you're away. It can also inform you to something occurring out of the camera's field of view.

<p>Lawbreakers have no pity. They stop at absolutely nothing to access to their target home, including smashing and slamming windows.

<p>The Google Nest Web Cam IQ Outdoor is the most technically sophisticated outdoor camera we have actually tested. It has a close-up tracking function, which immediately focuses on motion and after that follows it around the field of vision. To make those images clear, it has an 8-megapixel 4K sensor, HDR (high dynamic range), and 12 x digital zoom. It can compare general motion and people, so it cuts down on incorrect alarms, and it can even identify people you have actually identified (after a knowing period). However like all Nest cameras, this one needs the Nest Aware service to do anything beyond live viewing.</p>
<p>The SimpliSafe equipment is now in its 3rd version, with a simpler and more stylish style for both app and devices. The base station is curvier and the sensors are smaller sized, but the variety is better, promising connections to wireless sensors as much as 800 feet away. We didn't go that far, but we had the ability to set about 40 feet in different instructions, through walls to areas in the cooking area and dining room. </p>
