<p>Like the Nest Webcam IQ Indoor, this model has Familiar Face notifies, which can recognize individuals the camera is finding utilizing face acknowledgment. When it identifies a person in the frame, it will ask whether you know that individual and if so to tag them by name. After a while, the camera will find out to recognize those individuals and will send out smartphone signals with that information when they show up at your home. We believe this feature (which needs a Nest Aware membership) is more worthwhile outdoors, where you are more likely to want to differentiate anticipated visitors from random strangers. We also found the feature to be more dependable on the IQ Outdoor than on the indoor IQ design (on the indoor model, this function was always asking us to determine faces on a close-by TV). Three microphones (versus the Nest Camera Outdoor's one) also offer a wider series of audio, so you can much better hear what's going on in recordings. </p>
