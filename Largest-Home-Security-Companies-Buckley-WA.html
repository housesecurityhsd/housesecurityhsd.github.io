<h3>Security System Reviews in Buckley WA</h3>

<p>The Hive View provides terrific 1080p images day and night, but the motion activation set off too easily, even when on the most affordable sensitivity setting. Given that this camera has no native geofencing functions, you need to manually stop notices (and recording, because it does that even when alerts are off). We also experienced above-average connectivity issues, with 2 Hive test systems detaching eight times over two months.</p>
