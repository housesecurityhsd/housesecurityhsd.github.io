In Los Angeles, for instance, all alarm calls need to be verified, either by an eyewitness or through video or audio from a surveillance camera or microphone. Salt Lake City requires confirmation from a personal security personnel. Numerous cities also need a license to even own and operate a home security system.

<p>A self-monitored system needs to be wise. It should have the ability to follow guidelines with cause-and-effect relationships in between different devices. For example, if carbon monoxide gas is detected, you can create a rule to turn your heater off. Or you can create another rule that states if the front door is open, your security camera need to automatically begin tape-recording video footage. In doing so, it can possibly secure your home from flooding, fire, or perhaps rapidly changing temperature levels.</p>
<p>When your video cameras are installed, you can pick whether your cameras will be monitored by the main station. If you choose to have your cameras monitored (this is generally provided for cameras that are monitoring outdoor locations), then yes, main station operators will see the video that is taped when an alarm is triggered. Nevertheless, you may select to NOT have your cameras monitored by the Central Station (this is typically done for cameras that are monitoring indoor, residential areas). Cameras that are not monitored by the central station can not be accessed our operators for any factor, even if asked for by the customer. </p>
