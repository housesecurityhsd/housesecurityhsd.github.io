The implicit validation for the recent push to increase video surveillance is the threat of terrorist attacks. But suicide enemies are clearly not discouraged by video cameras - and might even be drawn in to the tv protection cameras can make sure - and the expenditure of an extensive video surveillance system such as Britain's - which sucks up roughly 20 percent of that nation's criminal justice spending plan - far exceeds the limited benefits that the system may provide in examining attacks or tried attacks after the reality (see reality sheet on Surveillance Cameras and the Attempted London Attacks ).</p>
