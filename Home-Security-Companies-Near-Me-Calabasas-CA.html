These battery powered styles can last for as much as 2 years prior to charging.</p>

The captured digital video stream is then transmitted over a local location network (LAN) using Ethernet (CAT5 or CAT6) cable to a Network Video Recorder (NVR), which catches each camera's signal, compresses, and records it to a storage drive for retrieval and review. The system can be established to interact by means of network or mobile app for seeing.</p>
