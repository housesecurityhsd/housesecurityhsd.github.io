<p>MAC filtering is effective just for small residential (SOHO) networks, considering that it supplies protection only when the wireless gadget is "off the air".

In an organizational environment, where most wireless devices are "on the air" throughout the active working shift, MAC filtering offers just a false complacency considering that it prevents just "casual" or unintentional connections to the organizational infrastructure and not does anything to prevent a directed attack.</p>
