<p>With clear, HD video - day or night - it's easy to sign in on the kids; 2- and four-legged alike. We initially observed Wyze because its super-cheap indoor security camera advised us of Disney's WALL-E Once we tried it out, it quickly ended up being a personnel (and family and friends) favorite. I do not recommend SimpliSafe 3 as a self-monitored system. As a self-monitored system, it is absolutely nothing more than a noise maker. It can't send out signals, you can't control it remotely, and you will not have access to their home security camera.</p>
