<p>We mounted our test group of outdoor Wi-Fi cameras to a board outside the house so we could point them at the exact same area and expose them all to the very same lighting conditions and New England weather condition. The exceptions were cameras that were integrated into outdoor lighting components, which I had set up on the porch by a licensed electrical expert (who occurs to be my husband). All of the cameras were linked to the exact same 2.4 GHz network through a Wi-Fi router indoors (approximately 40 feet from the cameras); service to your home was Verizon Fios.</p>

The base station is curvier and the sensing units are smaller, but the range is much better, appealing connections to wireless sensing units as much as 800 feet away. We didn't go that far, but we had the ability to set about 40 feet in different instructions, through walls to areas in the kitchen and dining-room. </p>
