<p>Seismic glass-break detectors, usually referred to as shock sensing units, are different in that they are set up on the glass pane. When glass breaks it produces specific shock frequencies which take a trip through the glass and often through the window frame and the surrounding walls and ceiling.

Seismic glass-break detectors feel these shock frequencies and in turn create an alarm condition.</p>

<p>The hermetically sealed reed switch is a really typical kind of two piece sensing unit that runs with an electrically conductive reed switch that is either generally open or generally closed when under the influence of a magnetic field as in the case of distance to the 2nd piece which includes a magnet.
