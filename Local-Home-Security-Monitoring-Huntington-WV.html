A thermal camera includes a heat sensor that is capable of detecting small distinctions in temperature level.

If you plan to pair the Ring Alarm with any of Ring's video doorbells or cameras, please first read the What about Ring? area from our smart video doorbell guide. While our company believe Ring's flaws are a dealbreaker when it comes to video items, we don't believe that these issues alter the functionality and user experience of the Ring Alarm, so we remain confident in our current recommendation.</p>
