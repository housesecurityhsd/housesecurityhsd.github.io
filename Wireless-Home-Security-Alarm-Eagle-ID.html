This model from Samsung Wisenet will fit the costs if you're looking for a robust DVR system that feels premium and records in 2K quality. It ships with four streamlined and white bullet-style cameras developed for indoor and outdoor usage.

Like others on our list, the DVR system deals with a mobile app that lets you see what the cameras are seeing in real-time, though we discovered in our testing that the app occasionally forgot cameras which then needed to be re-added.</p>

Logitech does make a cordless variation of the Circle 2, though we do not suggest it because its battery-saving regimens can interrupt performance.</p>

The more megapixels a camera sensor has, the more you can digitally zoom in and still have the ability to see things plainly.</p>
