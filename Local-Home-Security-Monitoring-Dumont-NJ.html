<p>With clear, HD video - day or night - it's easy to sign in on the kids; 2- and four-legged alike. We first noticed Wyze since its super-cheap indoor security camera reminded us of Disney's WALL-E Once we attempted it out, it quickly became a staff (and family and friends) favorite. I do not suggest SimpliSafe 3 as a self-monitored system. As a self-monitored system, it is absolutely nothing more than a sound maker. It can't send informs, you can't manage it from another location, and you will not have access to their home security camera.</p>
