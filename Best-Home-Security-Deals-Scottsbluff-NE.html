<p>Commercial-grade cameras fix this problem with a special light-handling feature. These cameras utilize both a software application and hardware service called HDR, which represent High Dynamic Range". In our example here, HDR takes an exposure of the space and a direct exposure of the entrance and then integrates the two images together to develop a properly-exposed composite picture of the 2 locations. As far as anyone is concerned, the image looks entirely normal because the doorway and space appear to be at the very same brightness level. As a result, faces are appropriately exposed at the door and in the store, achieving the objective of recording video of everyone entering the store. HDR is now a basic function in commercial cameras. Unfortunately, as soon as consumers recognize that the economical customer camera they purchased is lacking HDR, it's usually too late because the recorders and cameras are set up.</p>

Hardwired systems require very little maintenance, and except a general power failure, are more difficult to disrupt. Regardless of a basic enhancement in wireless technology, there seem less methods for hardwired systems to be interrupted and paralyzed. </p>
