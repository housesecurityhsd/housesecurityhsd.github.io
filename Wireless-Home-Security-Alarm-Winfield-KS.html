<p>What is a thermal camera, and where might you want one? Here is a short explanation of how thermal cameras work: All objects give off infrared energy (heat) as a function of their temperature level. The infrared energy produced by a things is referred to as its heat signature. In general, the hotter a things is, the more radiation it discharges. A thermal camera consists of a heat sensing unit that is capable of identifying tiny differences in temperature level. The device gathers the infrared radiation from objects in the scene and creates an electronic image based on details about the temperature level differences. Since items are seldom precisely the same temperature as other things around them, a thermal camera can identify them, and they will appear as unique in a thermal image.</p>

Whatever the components are (camera, motion sensing unit, window sensor, wise lock, and so on), I want to ensure that they all quickly interact with your app that is always at hand, so you can keep an eye on them from afar.</p>
