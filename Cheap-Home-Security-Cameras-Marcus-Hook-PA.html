<p>MAC filtering works only for small residential (SOHO) networks, considering that it supplies protection only when the wireless gadget is "off the air".

Anybody with an 802.11 receiver (laptop and wireless adapter) and a freeware wireless package analyzer can get the MAC address of any transmitting 802.11 within range. In an organizational environment, where most wireless devices are "on the air" throughout the active working shift, MAC filtering provides only an incorrect complacency given that it avoids only "casual" or unintentional connections to the organizational facilities and not does anything to prevent a directed attack.</p>
