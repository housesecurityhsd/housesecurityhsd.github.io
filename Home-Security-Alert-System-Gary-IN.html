<p>Smart alarms are simply as effective as standard burglar alarms however they do not constantly have an external siren that rests on the front of your home, which can act as a deterrent to burglars.

If you plan to pair the Ring Alarm with any of Ring's video doorbells or cameras, please first read the What about Ring? area from our clever video doorbell guide. While we believe Ring's defects are a dealbreaker when it comes to video items, we do not believe that these problems alter the performance and user experience of the Ring Alarm, so we stay positive in our present recommendation.</p>
