Certainly not perfect-- however the associate asked forgiveness and delivered her replacement control board overnight.</p>

<p>When using IP cameras - as most CCTV systems do nowadays - you will most likely be taking a look at Cat5E or Cat6 cable televisions, which can move the large amount of data needed by digital video and high resolutions at extremely quick speeds, and frequently over fars away. This is an upgrade from the coax cabling that typically powers analog security cameras; coax cable televisions are reliable, however not suitable with IP cameras. In most cases, Cat5e and Cat6 cable televisions will also power the security cameras, getting rid of the need for further wiring. This is called Power-Over-Ethernet and requires a PoE switch when the security cameras are not connected to an NVR. Wireless security cameras might require less circuitry in the walls but will still need cables to power the security camera individually, normally by means of 110VAC power. </p>
