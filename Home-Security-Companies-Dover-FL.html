At 80dB, it's about as loud as a food processor whereas many other alarm are as loud as 90dB or even 105dB. Regardless of that, the alarm should be enough to scare away trespassers in most cases. To recover costs and hold alarm companies accountable for incorrect alarms, Seattle works straight with your alarm company instead of with you.

Tight wire systems can run with a variety of switches or detectors that pick up movement at each end of the tense wires. These switches or detectors can be a simple mechanical contact, fixed force transducer or an electronic pressure gauge. Undesirable alarms triggered by birds and other animals can be avoided by adjusting the sensing units to neglect things that put in percentages of pressure on the wires.
