<h2>Ganz Security Solutions, Video Surveillance Security Lithia</h2>
<p>To determine response times for the monitoring company, we activated each system a minimum of 5 times, using contact and motion sensing units.

Thankfully, there are numerous systems on the market that offer property owners the power to self-monitor, which indicates they can monitor their own home.

<p>The problem with the small, fixed LED IR cameras is the plastic utilized in front of the lens and sometimes, the actual lens. After a few years in the harsher environments, this plastic tends to fade and become milky. This makes it hard for the CCD or CMOS sensor to successfully equate the images, and if there's a series of LED IR lights surrounding the lens, it can trigger a halo-like affect that blurs the image day and night. Inside, these gadgets have a far longer life expectancy, however outdoors, or even in a garage without climate control, many of them lose their sharpness and clarity succumbing to the extreme environment.</p>
