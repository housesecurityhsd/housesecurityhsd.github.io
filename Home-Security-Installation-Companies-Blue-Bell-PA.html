<p>But monitored systems also tend to have a service contract, which locks you into paying an often-pricey month-to-month cost for a set quantity of time, normally one to 5 years. No-contract systems, which permit you to spend for monitoring services on a month-to-month basis rather than devoting to a long-lasting arrangement, are becoming more common.
