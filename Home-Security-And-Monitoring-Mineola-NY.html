For beginners, Deep Knowing permits someone to discover what they are trying to find without needing to search through hours of ineffective video footage.

<p>Lighting: Lots of security cameras are able to shoot in what is referred to as "low-light infrared," allowing them to record clear footage in dark conditions. These cameras depend on infrared LED lights, which cover the dark area in infrared light. Unlike human beings, the camera has the ability to see this infrared light, so when those wavelengths reflect back, it's as if the camera is shooting footage in a brightened space. The more IR LEDs that a camera has, the much better it has the ability to see at night. Make sure your camera has plenty of IR LEDs if capturing video in the dark is a concern.</p>
