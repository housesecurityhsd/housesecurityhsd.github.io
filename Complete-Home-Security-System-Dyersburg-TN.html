<p>The problem with the small, fixed LED IR cameras is the plastic utilized in front of the lens and sometimes, the real lens. After a couple of years in the harsher environments, this plastic tends to fade and become milky. This makes it hard for the CCD or CMOS sensor to effectively translate the images, and if there's a series of LED IR lights surrounding the lens, it can trigger a halo-like affect that blurs the image day and night. Indoors, these devices have a far longer life expectancy, but outdoors, and even in a garage without climate control, a number of them lose their sharpness and clarity succumbing to the severe environment.</p>
<p>False alarms are costly for the City of Plymouth. Authorities respond to thousands of false alarms each year. The purpose of an alarm ordinance is to encourage alarm users to keep the functional reliability and proper use of alarm systems and to decrease or get rid of incorrect alarms. We also motivate users to instantly contact their monitoring companies on accidental journeys to cancel police response. </p>
