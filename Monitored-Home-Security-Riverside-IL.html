Many wireless keypads are positioned by the front door, but it doesn't need to be. You might want numerous keypads if your home has multiple entrances that are often utilized, such as one by the front door and one in the garage, or if your home is several stories. The keypad enables you to enter your security code in case the alarm is triggered while you are at home. Pick an accessible placement that works for you.</p>

<p>Cameras with built in wifi that speak with an existing network should be within 300 feet for ideal efficiency. With cameras that interact with wifi NVR's placement of the camera near to the NVR is absolutely something to be taken into account. For example if the only thing blocking the NVR from a camera is a window there wouldn't be much of a problem but if there is an insulated wall in between the camera and NVR or the NVR is down stairs and the camera is installed on 2nd story wall, this would cause a disruption in the signal.
